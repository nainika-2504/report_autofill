# Lab Report AutoFill — B2B Data Entry Extension

A powerful, dynamic browser extension built for B2B diagnostic labs that receive reports from external facilities and need to re-enter values into their own internal web portals every day.

Upload a PDF lab report once. The extension reads whatever fields are visible on your screen, finds the matching values inside the PDF, and fills them in — instantly.

## ✨ What's New in v1.1

- **Plain-English results panel** — After filling, the popup shows only what needs attention: warnings to double-check and fields it couldn't find. No clutter.
- **Range validation** — If a filled value looks medically implausible (e.g. Hemoglobin of 227), it flags it for review instead of silently entering the wrong number.
- **Extension icon** — Now shows a proper icon in your browser toolbar.

## 🔑 Key Features

### Dynamic Screen-Driven Matching
The extension never hardcodes test names. It reads the labels on your website right now and hunts the PDF for those exact names. This means it works with **any** external lab PDF format and **any** internal portal — without needing configuration.

### Multi-Layer Fallback Engine
For every field on screen, the agent tries:
1. Exact label match
2. Shortened name (strips parentheses)
3. Medical synonym lookup (SGPT = ALT, WBC = Leucocytes, HbA1c = Glycosylated Hemoglobin, etc.)
4. Range validation cross-check

### Cross-Tab Memory
Upload the PDF once. Fill the LFT tab, save, switch to the CBC tab — the PDF is still in memory. Click Start Autofill again. No re-uploading between tabs or between page reloads.

### 100% Local — No Data Leaves Your Browser
PDF parsing is done entirely in-browser using [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/). Nothing is sent to any server.
